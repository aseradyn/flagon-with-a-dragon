	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Professionally, I am a "UX Developer", which means that I design and build applications. 
		My primary experience is with business applications - the kinds of tools that allow businesses
		to track and report on their internal activities so that they can make good decisions. I am currently
		employed by HCSS, a company in Sugar Land, TX that creates software for the heavy construction industry. 
		I am embedded in one development team, help out several more, and am part of the effort to create a 
		component library / design system for our web products.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of work, I am a serial hobbyist: I love learning new things, and every few months I seem to
		find myself with something new to try out. My longest-running hobbies are photography, spinning (making yarn from wool or cotton fiber), weaving cloth,
		and gardening (flowers, not vegetables). Recently, I've also played with watercolors, basket weaving, dyeing,
		and card-making.

	<h2>About This Site</h2>
	<p>
		The site is built with SvelteKit, compiled into a static site, and hosted on Digital Ocean's App Platform. SvelteKit is a new
		thing for me, and I've been falling in love with it's developer experience.

	<p>
		I use Cloudinary as a CDN for my photos. Because I'm cheap and don't need anything fancy,
		I just use do a lot of copy-paste of URLs into my local objects, and use the URL arguments (from the
		<a href="https://cloudinary.com/cookbook">Cloudinary Cookbook</a>) for the little bit of image manipulation I need.
