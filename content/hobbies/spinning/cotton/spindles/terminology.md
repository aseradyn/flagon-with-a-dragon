Terminology
===========

Some of the American terminology for cotton spindles comes from Asian languages. I am including it here even where it may be technically inaccurate or culturally mis-applied because the terms are so widely used and therefore very helpful when shopping.

__whorl__: the bead or disc of heavier or denser material extending out from the spindle. This is what allows the spindle to spin longer than if it were just a stick.

__hook__: a small, well, hook, at the top of some spindles. The hook can be used to start spinning without a leader, or to hang the spindle from the yarn while spinning.

__support spindles__: a spindle that is primarily or exclusively used with the tip of the spindle resting on a surface, like a table or a bowl in your lap.

__drop spindle__: a spindle that is suspended from the yarn while spinning, and so can be used while standing or walking.

__takli__ or __tahkli__: a small support spindle, usually made of brass or other metal, consisting of a narrow shaft and a small, heavy disc near the bottom. The most common variety are made in India. I am told this is the Urdu word for spindle. These may or may not have a hook.

__Akha spindle__: a very light weight wooden drop spindle with a hook at the top and a whorl in the middle. These are named after a group of people living in Indonesia, though few (if any) of the "Akha" spindles available in the US are made by them.
