Books I Love
============

History
-------

_The Splendid and the Vile_ by Erik Larson

This was a very personal journey through the early part of WW2 following the primary characters in the British government. I couldn't put it down.

_The Storm Before the Storm_ by Mike Duncan

I love the _History of Rome_ and _Revolutions_ podcasts, so I'm probably a bit biased here, but I thought this was a great read. Instead of following Julius Caesar and Pompeii Magnus, who tend to steal the limelight, this book steps back one or two generations to their parents and grandparents and the disruptions in the republic that made the rise of the empire possible. Really good.

_The Ghost Map_ by Steve Johnson

This book covers not just John Snow and his famous effort to stop a cholera epidemic in London, but the whole milieu in which it occurred - how London worked as a city, how people got water and removed waste, how they worked and lived, and how their doctors understood biology and medicine. It's fascinating and fantastic.

_The Domestic Revolution_ by Ruth Goodman

I never knew I wanted to learn about pre-industrial cooking fuel, cleaning technology, or English recipes, but it turns out I did! The author does deep dives into subjects that are surprisingly fascinating, in service of connecting the rise of coal as a cooking fuel in Elizabethan England to the roots of the Industrial Revolution.

_1491_ by Charles C. Mann

No way around it, this is a dense tome. But it provides a glimpse into a world I never learned about in school - the Americas before Colombus. He walks you through the evidence - archaeological, historical, and more - to illuminate two continents absolutely brim-full of people living in sophisticated civilizations, managing their lands, waging war, and building cities. I have found this book to be a solid framework for understanding a lot of the archaeology and analysis that has been published in the popular press over the last decade.

_1493_ by Charles C. Mann

This book provides a fascinating look at how quickly and drastically the world changed as the Americas were connected by trade with Europe, Africa, and Asia. Plants, animals, people, and ideas flowed around the globe, changing cuisines, technologies, and societies in ways that we hardly see now because we are living in the results. From silver from Peru tanking the value of global currencies to rubber trees from the Amazon transforming forests in China to American potatoes helping peasants survive the endless European wars, there's kind of a lot to talk about.
