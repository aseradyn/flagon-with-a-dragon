Weaving a Reed Basket
=====================

I made a basket!

On Saturday, I took a basket weaving class from a local weaver at [our guild](http://www.weavehouston.org). I am hooked!

The project was a "wool drying basket". This is a traditional basket, with variations all over Europe, for drying wool after it has been washed. It has an open weave bottom and feet to raise it off the ground, so that air can flow through the wool and help it dry faster.

I have to say that I am quite pleased with how this basket turned out. I need more practice, but this is a sturdy basket that should be genuinely useful for years to come. It's big enough to actually do something with. I don't spend much of my life washing wool, but I do store throw blankets in my living room all summer, and I can hope that they will smell less musty in the fall if I store them in a basket like this. And if not? Well, it'll still be pretty :)

We were not able to complete the baskets in a single class session, so I brought home my 3/4 finished basket and some extra supplies so I could finish it at home. I went ahead and ordered some basic tools, because, well, this will _not_ be the last basket I make. It was so much fun! I love baskets, and want to be able to make them custom to suit some of my unusual use cases.
