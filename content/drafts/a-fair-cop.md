A Fair Cop
==========

Tips for winding a good cop when spinning cotton:

* You want the whole cop to be of similar fatness. This helps prevent sudden changes in spindle speed when unwinding (which can lead to breaks). So, start by wrapping all the way up to as high as the cop would be comfortable on the spindle, then keep going back and forth that whole width. It will look like a pencil to start, but eventually fill out. Even when the spindle is full, you want a gentle taper, not a broad cone.
