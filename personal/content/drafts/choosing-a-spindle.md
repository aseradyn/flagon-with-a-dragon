A Good Spindle
==============

The "best" spindle is very much dependent on the spinner. Weight, materials, size, and so forth come into play. In general, all good cotton spindles have two characteristics:
* They spin very fast
* They put very little weight on the proto-yarn while it is being spun

Support Spindles
----------------

Most cotton spindles are support spindles, meaning they sit on a table or in a bowl while spinning. This allows the actual spindle to be a bit heavier.

These spindles can be made from a wide variety of materials. I commonly see these made using brass or stainless steel shafts, usually with metal whorls, but they can also be made of wood or other materials. The whorls can be very plain (just a disc) or quite fancy - including paint, filigree, shiny stones, flowers set in resin, etching, and so forth. As long as the whorl is evenly balanced (no side is heavier than any other), it should spin well.

You can also just knock together a spindle from stuff sitting around the house. I once made a spindle from a bamboo skewer, a big washer, some kitchen string, and a few dabs of glue. It was very light, and well balanced, and it was easy to spin good yarn with. It just wasn't very sturdy - I dropped it and it fell to pieces.

But what's really important about the spindles is that they feel good to use. If you get a lot of joy from watching rhinestones glitter as they spin, by all means, search out a bedazzled spindle. If you love the feel of wood under your fingers, try the wooden ones.

My favorite support spindle is the ["Mistral" spindle from Hip Strings](https://hipstrings.com/collections/spindles/products/squall-spindle-pick-your-whorl). It is very light, with a carbon fiber shaft and a resin whorl. The carbon fiber is not slippery, like polished metals are, so I can get it spinning with less "squeeze" pressure from my fingers - important because I am developing arthritis. It is ridiculously sharp, which helps give it a decent length spin despite its lightness, but also makes it inappropriate around small children.

Drop Spindles
-------------

There are a few spindle makers who make very light wooden spindles that are suitable for cotton when used as drop spindles. These may be sold as "Akha" spindles. Whatever they are called, they usually weigh in at or under 0.5 ounces.


Driven Spindles

Fortunately, most cotton spindles, except the very fancy ones with hand-carving or sparkly stones or such, come in under $50. A basic brass "takhli" from India, which is an excellent spindle, runs about $20-25 from online retailers like The Woolery.
