I love 'em. Here's some favorites.

* Gastropod: About "food through the lens of science and history". Each episode has a topic, like 'beans' or 'olive oil' or 'why food tastes different depending on what your spoon is made out of' and they do a deep dive on that topic, pulling in science, lived experiences, and history - whatever makes it interesting.
* 99% Invisible: This one is about the design of everyday things, from built structures to tools to institutions. Some recent favorites include a series of mini-stories about trains, a model 'village' for people with dementia, the origins of 'Who let the dogs out', and the punk scene in LA's Chinatown.
* Articles of Interest: Deep dives on clothing as object/concept. I'm just a few episodes in, but it's really good. Come for stories about why kid's pajamas are skin tight or the role plaid cloth has played in cultures around the world, stay for the history of the Jacquard loom.
* The Big Dig: A mini-series, really, that walks through the history of the Big Dig, a massive infrastructure project in Boston. Where did the idea originate? How did it ever get built?
* The Disconnect: Another finite series, this one about the record-breaking power blackout in Texas during a winter storm. It's looking at the lived experience, but also the history and politics that led us to that point. A second season tries to look at what's changed since then - will it happen again? Particularly recommended for folks in Texas.
* Cautionary Tales: Every episode walks through a tale of failure, error, and bad luck, and tries to work out what lessons we can learn from those stories. The stories are told with empathy and humor, so it's not as dark as it sounds.
