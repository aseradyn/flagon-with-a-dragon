## Learning to Weave

The "best" way to learn to weave depends on your own learning style, abilities, equipment, and financial resources. Here's some options.

### In-Person Classes

A lot of large cities (and quite a few medium-sized ones) have weaving "guilds" (basically non-profit organizations that bring weavers together to socialize, learn, and share). Because teaching new people to weave is a solid way to increase membership in the guild, a lot of them offer some kind of weaving classes, or can at least help hook you up with a local teacher.

A class is great if you learn better in person, with a teacher that can help you find errors, solve problems, and answer questions. Many classes have looms either included or available to rent, so they're also a good option if you don't want to invest in the equipment before you know if you even like the craft. A _local_ class is nice because it can help hook you into a local weaving community for ongoing support and further learning.

There are also a few "destination" craft schools that teach weaving. You travel to the school for a few days, a week, or sometimes more of classes on a specific topic. A lot of them teach weaving as either one option or their whole deal.

Here's the ones I've heard about:

* [Red Stone Glen Fiber Arts School](www.redstoneglen.com): Located in Pennsylvania, with classes in weaving, dyeing, and spinning. Tom Knisley has a reputations as a great weaving teacher, and I've talked to several people who took classes from him while he was still teaching at conferences and guilds, and they all recommend him. I'd hope that the school he runs has other equally capable teachers.
* [The Folk School](www.folkschool.org): All kinds of craft classes, including beginning and intermediate weaving classes. Located in North Carolina. I haven't personally been there, but I've wanted to go for years.
* [Tierra Wools](www.handweavers.com): Beginning and intermdeiate weaving classes taught on Rio Grande style "walking" looms. Located in northern New Mexico. I've taken their tapestry class, and I loved working on these large looms, but it is very physical compared to other types of weaving I've done. The principles learned here can be applied to smaller looms as well.
* [Vavstuga Weaving School](www.vavstuga.com): Located in Massachusetts, this school focuses on Swedish-style weaving. They are also a big vendor of Glimakra and Oxaback looms, so if you are interested in those looms, taking classes here could be a great way to find out if they're a good fit.
