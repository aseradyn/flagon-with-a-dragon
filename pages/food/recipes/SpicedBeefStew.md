# Spiced Beef Stew

Tender, moist, and loaded with flavor, this is my favorite way to braise beef.

This is another one based on Zaynab Issa's 'Third Culture Cooking' book, her Spiced Short Ribs with Potatoes recipe

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds beef (stew meat, ribs, whatever)
* 2 onions
* 5 Tbsp double concentrated tomato paste
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 pop of ginger
* 2 tsp coriander
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* Dash of ground cinnamon
* Dash of cayenne pepper

## Instructions

Thinly slice the onions. Season the meat with salt and pepper.

In an oven-safe pot, sear the beef until browned on all sides (work in batches), and set aside.

Cook onions in beef fat until deeply browned. Add tomato paste and all seasonings, stir and cook just a minute, then add the beef and enough water to cover it. Give it a stir.

Bake, covered, at 375 for 3-4 hours. If your lid seals well, you may need to remove it near the end to help reduce the liquid to gravy-like consistency.
