# Pecan Pie

A good pecan pie, in my oh-so-humble opinion, should be absolutely full of pecans, from top to bottom. This recipe is my ideal.

This is a hand-me-down from my great aunt to my mother to me.

## Ingredients

* 3 eggs
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup dark Karo or maple syrup (the fake stuff)
* 1 1/2 cups pecans (...or more)
* 1 pie crust

## Instructions

Stir together all the ingredients. If it doesn't look like enough pecans compared to the goop, add more pecans.

Pour into the pie crust. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes, then at 350 for 20 minutes. Cover the crust for all but the last 10 minutes.
