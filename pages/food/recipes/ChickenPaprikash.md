# Chicken Paprikash

This recipe is based on the one from [Tasting History](https://www.tastinghistory.com/episodes/chickenpaprikash), but I cut the recipe roughly in half.

## Ingredients
* 2 lbs chicken thighs
* 1 onion
* 1 Tbsp paprika
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1/2 Tbsp flour
* 1/2 cup sour cream

## Instructions
1. Pat chicken dry and season with salt.
2. Finely dice the onion, and cook with oil and a little salt until golden brown.
3. Remove the pot from the heat (important!) and stir in the paprika.
4. Return to the heat and add chicken pieces one at a time, stirring to coat. Continue to cook until they start to get some color.
5. Pour in the chicken stock and stir, then simmer for 30 minutes. Turn the chicken and stir every 10 minutes.
6. Combine flour and sour cream, and then stir in a ladle of liquid from the pot. Mix thickener into the pot, and cook uncovered 20 minutes, or until thickened.
