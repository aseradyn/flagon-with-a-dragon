# Chocolate Chip Cookies

This is just the Tollhouse recipe, preseerved here so that I can check the ingredients before I go to the grocery store.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup butter
* 3/4 cup / 167 g sugar
* 3/4 cup / 135 g brown sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 2 eggs
* 2 1/4 cup / 300 g flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 12 oz bag of chocolate chips
* 1 cup nuts

## Instructions

Cream together butter and sugar, then vanilla and eggs.

Mix in flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.

Bake cookies at 375 for about 10-12 minutes.

## Tips

If you like your cookies thick and soft, swap in shortening for some or all of the butter, and keep the dough cold until it's ready to go in the oven.

If you like them thin and crunchy around the edges (me! me!), stick with butter and let the dough sit for a bit to come to room temperature before baking.
