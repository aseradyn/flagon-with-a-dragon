# Fried Fish

The first time I made this, it was for a little dinner party, and it was a hit! I've made it several times since then, and it's always a good choice.

Based on instructions from 'The Art of Simple Food' by Alice Waters.

## Ingredients

* 4 fillets of sole or another mild, white, thin fish
* 1 egg
* Flour
* Breadcrumbs

## Instructions

Season fillets with salt and pepper, and other herbs if the mood takes you

Beat an egg with about a tablespoon of water.

Dredge the fish fillets in flour, then the egg, then breadcrumbs.

Refrigerate uncovered for about an hour

Fry in clarified butter (ghee), about 1/2" is usually enough
