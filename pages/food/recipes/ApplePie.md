# Apple Pie

This is my personal favorite apple pie. It's a classic pie, except that I cut the sugar in half and doubled the cinnamon, and I measure the apples with my heart. The result is a pie that is not syrupy-sweet and that is chock-ful of apples.

I just use the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts. They're easy and very good. The other brands I've tried have not been as good.

This is based on the recipe from the classic [Betty Crocker](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/apple-pie-recipe/c9a4acc6-85aa-4128-b0b0-1a17bdbe05e0) cookbook.

## Ingredients

* 6-10 Granny Smith-type apples, depending on the size of the apples
* Two pie crusts
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1 tsp cinnamon (...or more)
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1/8 tsp salt
* A little butter

## Instructions

Core, peel, and slice as many apples as will fit in your pie pan. More, if you want. A mound is good!

Stir the dry ingredients into the apples.

Assemble the pie. Put a few small slices of butter on top of the apples, under the crust.

Bake at 425 degrees for about 45 minutes. Cover the edge of the pie for the first 30 minutes.
