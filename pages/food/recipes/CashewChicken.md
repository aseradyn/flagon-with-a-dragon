# Cashew Chicken

This is a quick, homemade version of the American-Chinese classic dish. It's essentially what the name says: chicken and cashews in a sauce, served over rice.

I picked this one up from [One Dish Kitchen](https://onedishkitchen.com/cashew-chicken-recipe-for-one/). It's a great site for recipes that serve just one or two people. I upped the ginger and dropped the broccoli. Imagine your own favorite vegetable in there instead.

## Ingredients

### Sauce

* 2 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp honey
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 1 pod of frozen grated ginger
* 1 Tbsp water

### Chicken

* 1 chicken breast, cut into smallish pieces
* 1/2 cup chopped (fresh) onions
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/4 cup unsalted cashews

## Instructions

Whisk together all ingredients for the sauce, and set aside.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and saute to cook through.

Add onions, veg if any, and garlic. Cook until fragrant.

Add cashews and sauce. Simmer for about 5 minutes.
