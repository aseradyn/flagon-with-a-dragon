# Coffee Cake

This coffee cake is basically a dense cake with two layers of cinnamon-and-nut streusel. If you use salted butter in the streusel - which I recommend - you get that slightly-salty-sweet-nutty flavor, which is to die for.

I got this recipe from my mother, who got it from her aunt, who probably got it out of a magazine. The original called for shortening in the cake, but I usually use butter.

## Ingredients

### Streusel

* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 2 tsp cinnamon
* 2 Tbsp melted butter
* 1/2 cup chopped nuts

### Cake

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cup flour

## Instructions

Stir together the streusel ingredients until well combined and crumbly.

Cream together sugar and butter, then the egg and milk. Mix in remaining dry ingredients for the cake.

In a 9x9 pan, layer in half the batter, then half the streusel, then remaining batter, and remaining streusel. (The batter is thick, so this is a bit of a pain to get even. You can also use a knife to cut the streusel in.)

Bake at 375 for about 30 minutes.
