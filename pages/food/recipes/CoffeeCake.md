# Coffee Cake

## Ingredients

### Streusel

* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 2 tsp cinnamon
* 2 Tbsp melted butter
* 1/2 cup chopped nuts

### Cake

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cup flour

## Instructions

Stir together the streusel ingredients until well combined and crumbly.

Cream together sugar and butter, then the egg and milk. Mix in remaining dry ingredients for the cake.

In a 9x9 pan, layer in half the batter, then half the streusel, then remaining batter, and remaining streusel. (The batter is thick, so this is a bit of a pain to get even. You can also use a knife to cut the streusel in.)

Bake at 375 for about 30 minutes.
