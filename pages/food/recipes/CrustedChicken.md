# Crusted Chicken

Very flexible - use regular breadcrumbs instead of panko, other seasonings instead of Italian, other cheeses. For example, Ranch seasoning, Monterey Jack cheese, and some melted butter. See also [Onion Crunch Chicken](/food/recipes/OnionCrunchChicken) for another variant.

Based on several recipes from Hello Fresh, like this one: [Crunchy Italian Sheet Pan Bake](https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/crunchy-italian-chicken-sheet-pan-bake-67b55e3d7ee49499a5e3d3af)

## Ingredients

* 2 chicken breasts
* 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
* 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning
* 1/2 cup shredded Italian cheese blend
* Sour cream

## Instructions

Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.

Mix breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, and cheese.

Put the chicken on a sheet pan, and brush on a layer of sour cream (it's going to be your glue, so generous but not sloppy)

Pile/press the breadcrumb mixture onto the tops and sides of the chicken.

Bake on the top rack at 425 for 18 minutes.
