# Pumpkin Spiced Muffins

No idea where I got this one. 🤷‍♀️ I don't like the texture of pumpkin pie, but I love these muffins. Spices and pumpkin and nuts, oh yeah!

Double the recipe to use a whole can of pumpkin puree.

## Ingredients

* 1 box white cake mix
* 1 cup canned pumpkin puree
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/3 cup oil
* 4 eggs
* 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
* 1/2 cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

Beat everything except the pecans, then stir in most of the pecans. 

Pour into baking cups (about 24), then sprinkle on any remaining pecans.

Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.
