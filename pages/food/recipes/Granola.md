# Granola

## Ingredients

* 1 small package Quaker Oats
* 2 Tbsp cinnamon
* 1 cup chopped nuts
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 1/4 cup oil (microwave) or 1/2 cup oil (oven)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup raisins
* 8 oz brown sugar
* 1 Tbsp sesame seeds
* 1/4 cup honey

## Instructions

Stir everything together

### Microwave

Heat on 50% for 3 minutes, stir, and repeat until it smells done. 

(The original used the high setting, but microwaves are more powerful now and that scorches the raisins before the granola is done)

### Oven

Spread on a sheet pan and bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes.
