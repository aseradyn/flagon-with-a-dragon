# Chicken Ramen Noodle Soup

I had no idea chicken soup could be this good. Warm and comforting, mild but not bland. I keep coming back for more.

What I usually do here is make up a big pot with everything except the noodles, and freeze portions. Then take out a portion, bring it to a simmer, and cook some ramen noodles in it.

Based on Super Savory Chicken Noodle Soup from 'Third Culture Cooking' by Zaynab Issa. Seriously, check out the whole book. It's full of yum.

## Ingredients

* 1 lbs skin on, bone-in chicken thighs or breasts
* 2 pods of frozen ginger
* 6 cloves garlic
* 1 bunch scallions, sliced
* 1 Tbsp curry powder
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 1-2 carrots, diced small
* 1 Tbsp lime juice
* Ramen noodles

## Instructions

In a pot that is deeper than it is wide, saute ginger, garlic, and the white/pale parts of the scallions with a little salt, until they are softened. Stir in curry powder and some black pepper.

Add chicken broth, 3 cups of water, and the chicken. Simmer about 20 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.

Remove the chicken and add the carrots. Cook another few minutes.

If you are planning to eat the whole pot soon, go ahead and add ramen noodles and scallion greens, and cook until the noodles are soft, then remove from the heat.

If you are planning to use the soup later, remove from the heat at this point. Reheat later and cook the ramen at that time.

Remove skin and bones from the chicken, shred the meat and return it to the pot. Stir in lime juice.
