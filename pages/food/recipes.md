# Recipes

This is a (small, growing) collection of my favorite recipes, the ones I come back to over and over, for everyday cooking or for special feasts.

Please be aware that I wrote these recipes for myself, not for a book or blog. As such, they assume you are comfortable in the 
kitchen and often trust you to make judgement calls on time, temp, equipment, and so on. Wherever possible, I've linked back to a 
similar recipe that has more detail.

## Chicken

* [Cashew Chicken](/food/recipes/CashewChicken) - Classic American-Chinese dish, just what it says on the tin
* [Chicken Paprikash](/food/recipes/ChickenPaprikash) - Moist braised chicken in a paprika sauce

## Desserts

* [Apple Pie](/food/recipes/ApplePie) - A less sweet, more apple-y pie than you find in the shops
* [Chocolate Chip Cookies](/food/recipes/ChocolateChipCookies) - A classic for a reason
* [Coffee Cake](/food/recipes/CoffeeCake) - A classic cinnamon streusel coffee cake
