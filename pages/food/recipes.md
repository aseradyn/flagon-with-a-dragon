# Recipes

This is a collection of my favorite, most useful recipes, the ones I come back to over and over, for everyday cooking or for special feasts.

Please be aware that I wrote these recipes for myself, not for a book or blog. As such, they assume you are comfortable in the 
kitchen and often trust you to make judgement calls on time, temp, equipment, and so on. Wherever I know the source, I've linked back to a 
similar recipe that has more detail.

There's not a lot of sides listed, because mostly that means roasted vegetables or potatoes, or rice or bread or something, which I don't need recipes for.
