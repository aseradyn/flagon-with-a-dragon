        <p>
            Professionally, I work primarily with React and C#, with an emphasis on front-end code (I üíô CSS). I have
            worked with PHP for decades for personal projects, and am learning Svelte/SvelteKit.

            <h2>Javascript</h2>
            <p>
                IMHO, a little javascript goes a long ways. This section is really about javascript enhancements to
                static sites,
                not about the javascript-based frameworks like React and Svelte.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/highlight-menu-location">Highlight your location in a menu</a></h3>

        This is a pretty simple way to detect your current route and highlight the corresponding item in a menu.

            <h2>PHP</h2>
            <p>
                I have no time for people who want to dis PHP because it's not as fancy as their thing. PHP is super
                useful for
                simple projects or anything where I really need a server (file access, authentication, etc.) Plus, it's
                cheap
                to host, the documentation is exhaustive, and there are a million topics
                on Stack Overflow to help get you un-stuck. The tooling is dead simple, too, which I love - no webpack,
                no rollup, no babel.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/simple-php-router">A Simple PHP Router</a></h3>

        I decided to experiment and see if I could figure out how to build a router that matched the way I want to work
        (handling multiple page types, no database, minimal manual file updates), while remaining lighter and easier
        to tweak than the off-the-shelf packages. This is what I came up with.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/blog-with-markdown.md">A Simple Blog based on Markdown (no database)</a></h3>

        I have never particularly liked dealing with infrastructure, so the more I can do in code, the happier I am üòä
        This topic walks through an approach to creating a lightweight blog that gives you the simplicity and freedom to
        just upload
        a new .md file and know it'll show up on the site.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/links-in-php-and-html">Link Syntax Cheat Sheet: HTML and PHP</a></h3>

        Whenever I've been away from PHP for a while, I start to get mixed up about how to do relative and absolute
        paths. This is my cheat sheet
        for when I need a quick refresher.
