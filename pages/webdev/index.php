        <h1>👩‍💻 Web Development</h1>
        <p>
            Professionally, I work primarily with React and C#, with an emphasis on front-end code (I 💙 CSS). I have
            worked with PHP for decades for personal projects, and have started learning Svelte/SvelteKit.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/thing-of-the-day">A Thing-of-the-Day Function</a></h3>
        I wanted a way to show a quote of the day that would be the same for everyone and that would reliably
        change over on schedule, without needing a database.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="/webdev/simple-php-router">A Simple PHP Router</a></h3>

        I decided to experiment and see if I could figure out how to build a router that matched the way I want to work
        (handling multiple page types, no database, minimal manual file updates), while remaining lighter and easier
        to tweak than the off-the-shelf packages. This is what I came up with.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/blog-with-markdown">A Simple Blog based on PHP and Markdown (no database)</a></h3>

        I have never particularly liked dealing with infrastructure, so the more I can do in code, the happier I am 😊
        This topic walks through an approach to creating a lightweight blog that gives you the simplicity and freedom to
        just upload
        a new .md file and know it'll show up on the site.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/highlight-menu-location">Highlight your location in a menu</a></h3>
        This is a pretty simple way to detect your current route and highlight the corresponding item in a menu.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/links-in-php-and-html">Link Syntax Cheat Sheet: HTML and PHP</a></h3>

        Whenever I've been away from PHP for a while, I start to get mixed up about how to do relative and absolute
        paths. This is my cheat sheet
        for when I need a quick refresher.
