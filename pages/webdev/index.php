            Professionally, I work primarily with React and C#, with an emphasis on front-end code (I üíô CSS). I have 
            worked with PHP for decades for personal projects, and am learning Svelte/SvelteKit.

            I have no time for people who want to dis PHP because it's not as fancy as their thing. PHP is super useful for 
            simple projects or anything where I really need a server (file access, authentication, etc.) Plus, it's cheap 
            to host, the documentation is exhaustive, and there are a million topics 
            on Stack Overflow to help get you un-stuck. The tooling is dead simple, too, which I love - no webpack, no rollup, no babel.

    <p>
        I decided to experiment and see if I could figure out how to build a router that met several of my very specific
        criteria (handling multiple page types, no database, minimal manual file updates), while remaining lighter and easier 
        to tweak than the off-the-shelf packages. This is what I came up with. <a href="/webdev/simple-php-router">Read it</a>
