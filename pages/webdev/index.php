        <h1>üë©‚Äçüíª Web Development</h1>
        <p>
            Professionally, I work primarily with React and C#, with an emphasis on front-end code (I üíô CSS). I dabble with other tech, 
            especially PHP.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/php-is-good-actually">PHP is good, actually</a></h3>
        <p>
            I take a bit of crap at work for being the person who defends PHP. Today, I feel like explaining why.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/htmx-sample-squares-generator">Superbowl Squares Generator</a></h3>
        <p>
            A quick and dirty Superbowl Squares Generator as proof-of-concept for using htmx to add a little AJAX to a 
            static site.
        </p>
                
        <h3><a href="/webdev/json-from-worker-in-php">Reading JSON from Workers in PHP</a></h3>
        <p>    
            Super quick: getting a remote JSON value and converting it to an object.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/return-KV-from-worker">Returning KV values from Cloudflare Workers</a></h3>
        <p> 
            A quick look at how to take advantage of simple KV storage on Cloudflare.
        </p>

            <h3><a href="/webdev/thing-of-the-day">A Thing-of-the-Day Function</a></h3>
            I wanted a way to show a quote of the day that would be the same for everyone and that would reliably
            change over on schedule, without needing a database.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3><a href="/webdev/simple-php-router">A Simple PHP Router</a></h3>

            I decided to experiment and see if I could figure out how to build a router that matched the way I want to work
            (handling multiple page types, no database, minimal manual file updates), while remaining lighter and easier
            to tweak than the off-the-shelf packages. This is what I came up with.

        <h3><a href="/webdev/blog-with-markdown">A Simple Blog based on PHP and Markdown (no database)</a></h3>

        I have never particularly liked dealing with infrastructure, so the more I can do in code, the happier I am üòä
        This topic walks through an approach to creating a lightweight blog that gives you the simplicity and freedom to
        just upload
        a new .md file and know it'll show up on the site.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="/webdev/highlight-menu-location">Highlight your location in a menu</a></h3>
        This is a pretty simple way to detect your current route and highlight the corresponding item in a menu.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="/webdev/links-in-php-and-html">Link Syntax Cheat Sheet: HTML and PHP</a></h3>

        Whenever I've been away from PHP for a while, I start to get mixed up about how to do relative and absolute
        paths. This is my cheat sheet
        for when I need a quick refresher.
