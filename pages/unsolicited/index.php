            <h1>Unsolicited Advice</h1>
            <p>
                I have opinions on things. Especially work things. Work culture, team process, that bit. The goal for this section is to 
                help me clarify my thinking, get it off my chest, and maybe, maybe give someone else ideas along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything in this section is <em>opinion</em>, based on my personal experiences, practices, preferences, world view, etc. 
                So, buckets of salt and all that.
