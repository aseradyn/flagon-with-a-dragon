# Food, glorious food!

I love good food. And just to get this out of the way right up front: that does not mean fancy. I like simple foods, with lots of flavor and minimal fuss.

Here's an example: a good hamburger, to me, is just ground beef, gently patted into a circle, and grilled. Cook it so that it's still moist, and stay far away with that seasoning shaker. Top it with ketchup, and I'm happy. Add tomatoes and onions and bacon and cheddar cheese, and I'm in heaven. Slap it into a simple bun, maybe with sesame seeds, or a brioche roll if you're feeling fancy. But that's it. The toppings should not overwhelm the flavor of the burger. I shouldn't have to unhinge my jaw to take a bite. I should not be in danger of staining my clothes as the fillings squeeze out the back of the bun. Do you know how hard I had to look, when I first moved to Tucson, to find a burger place that met my standards? ([Zinburger](https://www.zinburgeraz.com/), if you're wondering. Classic burgers, excellent milkshakes.)

Ahem. That's probably enough about burgers. Sorry. Let's move on.

## Recipes

I enjoy cooking, rather a lot. I'm not, like, an expert chef. I'm no gourmand. But I know my way around a kitchen and can reliably turn out meals that make tummies happy. There's just something so satisfying about sitting down to a meal that is simple but full of flavor, and just what I was hungry for.

Here is a small, but intended to grow, collection of my favorite recipes. My go-tos. My repeats. I'm posting them here both to share them, and to serve as my personal recipe book.
