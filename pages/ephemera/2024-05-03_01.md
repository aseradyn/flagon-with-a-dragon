Can I just tell you how much I love this damned dog? Mud up to her eyeballs and just having a blast.

Taking my dog to daycare sounds like a very pretentious thing to do, but no lie, it's one of the best non-essential things I've ever spent money on. The dog clearly loves it; she gets exercise and entertainment and comes home happy to just snuggle and nap. And it means that I don't have to wear her out on a daily basis, so our play time can be just about enjoying ourselves.
