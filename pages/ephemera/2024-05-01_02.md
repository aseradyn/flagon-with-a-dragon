Over on weblog.lol they're trying to kick off a month of blog-writing ([WeblogPoMo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024)) for May.

I don't know that I'll post every day, but it did make me want to take another run at building a blog that suits my wants.

Today, I set up a quick way to post ephemera - things that vanish.  It will only show the most recent posts, and then they vanish.

(Ok, they don't actually vanish, but they roll off, and without links they become inaccessible. I am really digging the _ephemeral_ nature of that. I think I'll keep it.)
