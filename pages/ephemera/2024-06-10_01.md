This is an absolutely fascinating presentation from this year's Beyond Tellerand:

[No, Seriously, Fuck Engagement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTmSqxu3kWg)

A few of my initial thoughts, in no particular order:

* I'm not sure I buy the mirrors => war chain, but that's not essential to the heart of the argument

* The focus on engagement at all costs is a big part of why I got off Twitter and Facebook and all the rest (I'm still on Mastodon, because it doesn't try so hard). I realized it was bad for my brain.

* I think one of the reasons I'm so happy with my current job is that it does, really, align so well with my values. We're building genuinely useful tools, at a company full of people who honestly care for each other and for the success and happiness of our customers. It's imperfect, of course, and I worry about the next group of shareholders trying to wring more profit out of the company at the expense of its soul, but for now it feels precious and rare.

* I love the idea of people being born whole and complete and _themselves_, not raw clay to be molded and fired into a desired shape. How many coming-of-age stories have I read about someone breaking free of their parents' hopes and expectations and demands? Tropes are tropes for a reason.
