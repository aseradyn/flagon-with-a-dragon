It's been a busy spring!

The biggest work thing: We released the project I've been working on for the last year. It was my first project as a team lead, and it was a really big initiative for the company, so there was lots of executive attention. But we did it, and it looks like it's a success!

The biggest personal thing: I moved! The new home base is in Tucson, Arizona. Lots of packing, moving, unpacking, and exploring has happened over the last few months. I'll be sharing some of that here soon, if all goes according to plan.

I'm settling down into a new routine, and it's pretty hot out there, so I expect to spend more time and attention mucking around on web sites ðŸ˜Š
