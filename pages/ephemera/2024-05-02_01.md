I woke up way too early this morning.

I could have, like, started my day job, but ... meh.

Instead, I set up an FTP deployment pipeline for my site, so that pushing/merging to `main` branch automatically redeploys the site. Because that's what everyone does when they're done with their morning routine by 7am, right?

I also updated the [Info page](/info) to talk a little about my new day job project, and to show some love for this great deploy action on Github.
