I hosted a lovely, traditional little Thanksgiving dinner, just my mother and a couple of friends.

My mother brought over a turkey ready for the oven, then headed off to Phoenix to pick up a friend at the airport. It was my first time cooking a turkey, but it turned out delicious.

I made dinner rolls for the first time. I used a recipe from Preppy Kitchen: [Dinner Rolls](https://preppykitchen.com/dinner-rolls) They were soft and delicious, and actually really easy. I've added the recipe to my recipes page to use again later. Even if you've never made bread before, I bet you can make these! His video is excellent.

I also made mashed potatoes, and then friends brought stuffing and made gravy, and sliced up a can of cranberry jelly. And of course, I made apple pie.

It was a small get-together, but warm and friendly and happy. 10/10, would Friendsgiving again.
