At work, we're working on a new project that uses parts of Azure I've never messed with before. I'm learning about service buses, and queues, and function apps. The whole team is pretty new to this; we are familiar with these things _in concept_, but we've never actually built them before, run them before, so there's a lot of little places where we have to feel our way through it.

We're learning a lot, and that feels good. But there's also a huge pile of pressure sitting on this project, and this work feels slow, which makes me anxious.

Thank god I have a manager who believes that our work is not a sprint, is not even a marathon, but rather a lifelong exploration: you have to pace yourself to be able to keep going, day after day, month after month, year after year. He's got my back here, and helps me make sure we're spending our effort on the right things.
