In the spirit of using your website to celebrate that things that you love, I've started posting my favorite recipes in a new 'Food' section. Right this minute, it's like three recipes. I have some work to do!

But since we're cruising into holiday season, I thought I'd share two in particular: 

[Apple Pie](/food/recipes/ApplePie): If you've ever hated American apple pies because they are syrupy-sweet and more sauce than apples, this is the recipe for you. It's made with tart apples and just a quarter cup of sugar for the whole pie, so it tastes like spiced apples and is a great complement to ice cream. If I am asked to bring a pie for Thanksgiving dinner, this is always the first one they ask for.

[Coffee Cake](/food/recipes/CoffeeCake): This coffee cake was a family tradition when I was a kid; Thanksgiving morning, the Macy's parade on TV, and a slice of coffee cake on the couch. Cinnamon-streusel and a thick white cake - classic!

Mmmmm... now I'm hungry!
