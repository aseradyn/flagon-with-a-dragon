This morning I demonstrated spinning cotton on spindles and wheels for a group of middle- and high-school kids at the Eternal Ghandi museum in Sugar Land.

I say that not to brag, but to share my delight in how _fascinated_ the kids were by the whole process.  By the cotton and its seeds, by the tools themselves,  by the magic of using something so simple to pull thread out of raw fiber. By the enormous range of possible uses for thread and yarn you spin with your own hands.  

This kind of event just absolutely makes my day.

Now I need a nap.
