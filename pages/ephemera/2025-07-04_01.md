When you have a holiday afternoon all to yourself, what else is there to do but make a new theme for your web site? I was pretty happy with this one, so I decided to make it live.

This one was fun. Mostly CSS changes, but a few code updates to make it easier to re-theme in the future, and maybe have a theme switcher. No promises; we'll see what my mood is like!
