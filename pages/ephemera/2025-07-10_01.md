I'm playing with something new -- kind of a personal wiki. A place to share photos and stories from travel, pets, memories, events. Stuff that's personal but not private. Things I want to celebrate and remember and share.

There's not a lot there yet, just some smaller entries that are a kind of warm-up for larger updates, and the format will be evolving.

Available now under the [Life](/life) tab.
