Happy St Patrick's Day to those who celebrate üçÄ

Can I just take a minute to gush about the weather? The last few weeks have been spectacular by Houston standards. Cool mornings, warm-but-not-sweltering afternoons, sunshine, breezes... as close to idyllic as this place gets. I know we are doomed to summer again, but I'm sure enjoying a proper spring while it lasts!

I've been busy catching up on outdoor work, while it's actually nice to be out there: weeding flower beds, trimming bushes, clearing out the garage and shed of all the things I won't be taking with me when I move. Productive and pleasant in one go. I'm winning!
