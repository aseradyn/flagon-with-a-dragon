# Oreo

When I was in maybe the 5th or 6th grade, we got this adorable little puppy and named her Oreo, because we were kids and of course we did lol

We were living in Nigeria at the time, and came back to Rapid City in the summer to visit with relatives and have a taste of normal American life. The neighbors across the street had a daughter that I played with on the regular, and they also had an AKC-registered springer spaniel, who they'd been planning to breed. Apparently a stray did the deed one night unseen, because she became pregnant and had a litter of adorable little black puppies. I begged, like kids do, and my parents gave in and let us take one of the puppies when they were old enough.
