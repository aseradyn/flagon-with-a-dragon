# Tohono Chul Botanical Garden and Gallery

Tohono Chul is a neat little place in Tucson, Arizona. It's part garden, part natural space, part art gallery. Picture lots of winding little paths through flowers and trees, full of hummingbirds and bees and butterflies. There's a riparian area, with a running stream. There are lots of benches and chairs and even some swinging seats, inviting you to take your time and enjoy the space. Among the gardens are sculptures and other types of art, ramadas providing shade and shelter, gift shops, and an art gallery.
