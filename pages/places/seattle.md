# Seattle

I visited Seattle for a few days in September 2023. I had really gorgeous weather for much of my stay.

There were things I loved about Seattle: the aquarium, the light rail, the weather. But there are also things that make me glad not to live there: the cost of everything, and the fact that no matter where you want to go, it's uphill from wherever you are. So. Much. Climbing. It didn't help that I was still recovering from pneumonia, which turned any exertion into a fight for air. Still, I had a lovely time and would happily go back if I had an excuse.

## Around Town

I visited Smith Tower. The museum was pretty neat -- you just wander around rooms staged to look like they would have in the early 1900's, with lots of papers and doodads out to look at. The elevators are still done up with their brass cages (but I'm pretty sure they're much more modern than they look). The observation deck was terrifying - a narrow walkway with a cage around it, hanging out into space. I managed to get all the way around, with my back firmly pressed against the solid wall of the building, and then retreated inside.

I also took the ferry out to Bainbridge Island. The day started just overcast, but by the time we got out to the island it was getting pretty wet. I didn't explore the island; just got back on the ferry and headed back to town. The ride itself is what I was really after.

## Seattle Aquarium

I could have spent _days_ at the [Seattle Aquarium](https://www.seattleaquarium.org/). I was there on a weekday, so there were no crowds and I could take my time to just wander and watch and think. It was really lovely.

My favorite features were the touch pools and the underwater dome.

## Chuhuly Garden and Glass

I don't know why, but I expected the [Chuhuly Garden and Glass Museum ↗️](https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/) to be over-hyped. I was wrong. It was spectacular. The glasswork itself is gorgeous, and then the design of the museum, glass house, and gardens really shows it off to great effect. Worth every penny to get in.

When I went, you had to buy your ticket for a particular entry time. I got there, bought my ticket, and then wandered the grounds around the Space Needle and other attractions there for an hour or so before I could go in.
