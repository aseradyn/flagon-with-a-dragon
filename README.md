# flagon-with-a-dragon
A new site

This is the repo for my personal web site. I'm leaving the repo open just because... I dunno? I guess I kind of like that it's simple and easy to work with, the kind of thing you don't need a master's degree in webpack to work on. I've learned so much from looking at other peoples' code that it seems churlish not to share mine.
