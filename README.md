A new site

Some day, in a distant and future land, this may end up being my new, personal web site. In the meantime, it's a test bed.

I have been working as a React developer, and wanted to see how much of that I could apply to a PHP site. I love working with React components, but I missed the ease with which a new PHP site can get off the ground. This site is an attempt to marry what I love from both - I want to use composition to build up a flexible website that's easy to update, while keeping it light in the browser and painless to launch. 

I am hosting the repo on GitHub to take advantage of its basic IDE, so I can write and update content from anywhere, and for the actions, which should allow me to control when I push new versions of the site to my host.

I've made the repo public so that other people can poke around and see how it works under the hood. There's nothing proprietary or secret, and I learn a lot by looking at other peoples' examples - this is my little attempt to reciprocate.
