This tool is intended to help me track the things I need to help me manage my blood sugar levels.

At this time, I have no intention of making it into a consumer app or handling other use cases; I am Product Manager, Product Owner, Developer, Primary Stakeholder, and End User.

If you would like to use it, please feel free to copy the files from this directory and install it on your own server, with my good wishes.
